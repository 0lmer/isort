In this case if any of the imports change order you are changing the settings definition itself.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can configure isort to skip over just these files - or even to force certain imports to the top.\r\n\r\nConfiguring isort\r\n======================\r\n\r\nIf you find the default isort settings do not work well for your project, isort provides several ways to adjust\r\nthe behavior.\r\n\r\nTo configure isort for a single user create a ~/.isort.cfg file:\r\n\r\n    [settings]\r\n    line_length=120\r\n    force_to_top=file1.py,file2.py\r\n    skip=file3.py,file4.py\r\n    known_standard_libary=std,std2\r\n    known_third_party=randomthirdparty\r\n    known_first_party=mylib1,mylib2\r\n    indent='    '\r\n    multi_line_output=3\r\n    length_sort=1\r\n\r\nYou can then override any of these settings by using command line arguments, or by passing in override values to the\r\nSortImports class.\r\n\r\nMulti line output modes\r\n======================\r\nYou will notice above the \"multi_line_output\" setting. This setting defines how from imports wrap when they extend\r\npast the line_length limit and has 4 possible settings:\r\n\r\n0 - Grid\r\n\r\n    from third_party import (lib1, lib2, lib3\r\n                             lib4, lib5, ...)\r\n\r\n1 - Vertical\r\n\r\n    from third_party import (lib1,\r\n                             lib2,\r\n                             lib3\r\n                             lib4,\r\n                             lib5,\r\n                             ...)\r\n\r\n2 - Hanging Indent\r\n\r\n    from third_party import \\\r\n        lib1, lib2, lib3, \\\r\n        lib4, lib5, lib6\r\n\r\n3 - Vertical Hanging Indent\r\n\r\n    from third_party import (\r\n        lib1,\r\n        lib2,\r\n        lib3,\r\n        lib4,\r\n    )\r\n\r\nOrdering by import length\r\n======================\r\n\r\nisort also makes it easy to sort your imports by length, simply by setting the length_sort option to True.\r\nThis will result in the following output style:\r\n\r\n    from evn.util import (\r\n        Pool,\r\n        Dict,\r\n        Options,\r\n        Constant,\r\n        DecayDict,\r\n        UnexpectedCodePath,\r\n    )\r\n\r\nSkip processing of a single import\r\n======================\r\n\r\nTo make isort ignore a single import simply add a comment at the end of the import line containing the text 'isort:skip'\r\n\r\n    import module # isort:skip\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    from xyz import (abc, # isort:skip\r\n                     yo,\r\n                     hey)\r\n\r\nWhy isort?\r\n======================\r\n\r\nisort simply stands for import sort. It was originally called \"sortImports\" however I got tired of typing the extra\r\ncharacters and came to the realization camelCase is not pythonic.\r\n\r\nI wrote isort because in an organization I used to work in the manager came in one day and decided all code must\r\nhave alphabetically sorted imports. The code base was huge - and he meant for us to do it by hand. However, being a\r\nprogrammer - I'm too lazy to spend 8 hours mindlessly performing a function, but not too lazy to spend 16\r\nhours automating it. I was given permission to open source sortImports and here we are :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
