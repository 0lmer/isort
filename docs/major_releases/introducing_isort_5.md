Introducing isort 5.0.0!

isort 5.0.0 is the first major release of isort in over 5 years and the first major refactoring os isort since it was conceived more than 10 years ago.
This does mean that there may be some pain with the upgrade process, but we believe the improvements will be well worth it.
